    text: \n<FRILLY DRESS GIRL>Considerably powerful, too...\. Majestic beasts indeed.

intro_4:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<FRILLY DRESS GIRL>Kindness is only real when you have power to back it up with...\! Without it, it's simply weakness.

intro_5:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<FRILLY DRESS GIRL>So when such a creature spares you...\. You'd better be grateful.\. It's \sinv[1]true\sinv[0] kindness.

intro_6:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 13
    text: \n<FRILLY DRESS GIRL>Oh, where are my manners.\. I'm ALICE.\. Concise and succinct;\. I bear no other titles or decorations.

you_1:

    text: \n<ALICE>Me?\! Well, I suppose I did ask for a conversation...

you_2:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>I tend not to give too much information about myself.\! It gives a greater sense of mystery.

you_3:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>Fear of the unknown is one the most fundamental fears.\. It would be silly to not capitalize on it.

you_4:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>When I say I have no other name, I mean it.\. Having just a singular name is much more intimidating.

you_5:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>Sure, the name doesn't exactly sound formidable.\. But you know, a little juxtaposition goes a long way.

# > START NAME CHOICE

you_6:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 13
    text: \n<ALICE>I mean, what kind of last name would you expect of me anyways?

name_c1_1:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 13
    text: \n<ALICE>Ha ha.\! Very funny.\! Alice in Wonderland.\! A popular novel by Lewis Caroll.

name_c1_2:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>But I can't argue against that.\! I did base it on that story.\! Grim derivatives of it specifically, though.

name_c2_1:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>King-slayer, you mean.\. Sounds cool.\. Cannot argue with that.

name_c3:
    text: MARGATROID

name_c3_1:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 13
    text: \n<ALICE>What?\! That sounds like a name for a...\. magician, or something.\! Next you'll tell me there's someone named KNOWLEDGE because they read books.

name_c4:
    text: MARE

name_c4_1:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 13

bear_1:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>It's simple, I like animals.\! Not the pretty princess kind though, to be clear.

bear_2:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>As much as I tout about strength or survival of the fittest or whatever, I'm not the type to just go for senseless violence.

bear_3:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>All living beings deserve respect, just like we do.\. As much I'd like to beguile about mortality, the converse is also important.

bear_4:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>...I will admit, the bears are trapped in here at the moment. Does not seem to align with my aforementioned philosophy, does it?

bear_5:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>That's because it is temporary.\. I just need proper housing before... proper transportation.

bear_6:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>These animals are a commission, I can only hope they are also treated well at the destination...

bear_7:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>A bit of fancy words there, I know.\. I just like to ponder about it a lot in my own time.

battle_1:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>What's "playtime", you ask?\. With these little bears of course.\. They need some entertainment too, you know.

battle_2:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 15
    text: \n<ALICE>I can show you how to play with them if you want.\! You will be safe...\. If you know what you're doing.

battle_3:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>So... do you want to play with me?

battle_7:

    faceindex: 44
    text: \n<SPACEBOY>What in the stars is that?\! You call that playing?

battle_8:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>It's called play-fighting.\. Have you not heard of that before?\. It's just a silly game, nothing serious.

battle_9:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 15
    text: \n<ALICE>After all, you're alive right now.\. No real harm done, is there?

battle_10:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>Anyways, these bears are now thoroughly entertained, so they'll be docile towards you.\. You can walk around in the cage now,\. isn't that neat?

battle_11:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>By the way, I should mention...\. Behind the cage there is a hole...\. It's where a terrifying beast slumbers.

battle_12:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>Even I was unable to tame it.\. So challenge it on your own risk.

battle_13:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>Though if you ever do challenge it...\. I will be there to watch.\. That should be entertaining.

battle_14:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 15
    text: \n<ALICE>Just come back in one piece.\. I don't want to pick up your body parts after a gruesome mauling.

battle2_1:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 15
    text: \n<ALICE>Wow,\. you actually did it.\! I didn't think you'd actually go through with it.

battle2_2:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>Don't expect anything from me, though.\. You battled that beast by your own free will.

battle2_3:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>The experience you got should be worthwhile enough to you.\. I'm sure it was a thrilling one.

battle2_4:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>Well, that's enough entertainment for today.\. I'll go back to looking after my animals.

quest_1:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>A quest, huh?\. Do you just walk around running errands to be a good samaritan?

quest_2:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>But I can't exactly object, it would be great to have someone to help out...

quest_3:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>So...\. you know bunnies?\! Cute fluffy creatures, they are.

quest_4:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>Well...\. the bears aren't exactly...\. vegetarian. That should be common knowledge.

quest_5:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>That's where the rabbits come in.\! So many ways you could prepare them...\. Where do I even begin...

quest_6:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>I could start off by skinning one alive, perhaps.\. Followed by salt water in the wounds for flavor...\. And boiling it into a stew.

quest_7:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 13
    text: \n<ALICE>What?\! Why the looks?\! I am obviously joking.\! You cannot seriously think I'd do all that.

quest_8:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>Ethics aside, meat tastes better when it has been killed swiftly and painlessly.\. All hunters know that.

quest_9:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>Anyways...\. I can give you a task when you come talk to me again.\. I'll give you something in return too.\! Because I'm nice.

# ======== QUEST 1 ======== #

quest1_1:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>For the first quest...\. I'll start with something simple.

quest1_2:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>\c[4]Defeat \v[1001] bunnies\c[0].\! But the catch is...\. They must be \c[4]defeated while HAPPY\c[0].

quest1_3:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>That's because we must respect our prey.\. It's only fair to give them a peaceful way to go out...

quest1_4:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>Morbid, sure.\. But that's just how life is like sometimes.

# Not enough
quest1_5:

    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>Hmm... You've only defeated \c[4]\v[1584] HAPPY bunnies\c[0] so far.\. Not exactly enough... I need \c[4]\v[1001]\c[0].

# Enough
# ======== QUEST 2 ======== #
quest2_1:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14

    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>As promised, I'll compensate you with a reward...\! I'll teach you a \c[4]skill\c[0].

quest2_3:

quest2_5:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>With this new ability...\. you should be able to \c[4]instantly kill an enemy\c[0], with enough luck.

quest2_6:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 13
    text: \n<ALICE>Of course, this does not work with a more formidable foe.\. Don't fantasize too far now;\. Life ain't that easy.\.

quest2_7:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>Anyways, I also have a selfish reason for teaching you this skill...

quest2_8:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>For my next request,\. \c[4]defeat \v[1001] bunnies with instant kill skills\c[0].\! And I mean proper instant kills, not just absurdly high damage.

quest2_9:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>A quick, painless kill is the most humane way to slaughter.\. It also yields good quality meat.

quest2_10:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 13
    text: \n<ALICE>Merely severe damage isn't enough.\! That would just mangle the corpse beyond recognition.\! I'm making a stew here, not mush.

quest2_11:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>As a tip, LUCK is important here.\! It may be wise to use \c[4]LUCK based equipments and being HAPPY\c[4].

quest2_12:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>That's all for now.\! I expect swift delivery.

# Not enough
quest2_13:

    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>Hmm...\. You've only \c[4]instantly defeated \v[1585] bunnies\c[0] so far. Not exactly enough... I need \c[4]\v[1001]\c[0].

# Enough
quest2_14:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>Seems you've gotten enough bunnies there.\. You did not disappoint.

quest2_15:

    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>As a reward...\. I'll give you one of my \c[13]TRAGIC POEM\c[0]s.\! I have plenty anyways.

quest2_16:
    text: You got a \c[13]TRAGIC POEM\c[0].

quest2_17:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 14
    text: \n<ALICE>Equip this, and read it out loud.\! You'll get everyone \c[4]WEEPING\c[0].

    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>Anyways, for next request, I will need to prepare something for a bit.\! Come talk to me again when you're ready.

quest3_2:

    faceindex: 12
    text: |
        \n<ALICE>I prepared a bunch of critters: A FIERY, and bunch of BUGS BUNNIES.

quest3_3:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>The FIERY possesses a unique magical flame...\. That would make a great roast of those bunnies.

quest3_4:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>\c[4]Regular fire will not cut it\c[0], so you will need to find a way to \c[4]CHARM the FIERY to make them inflict BURN on the bunnies\c[0].

quest3_5:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>And remember to \c[4]kill ALL the bunnies while they're BURNING\c[0].\! Don't want to let it put itself out, now.

quest3_6:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 13
    text: |
        \n<ALICE>Why not just ask the FIERY for help?\! I was unable to convince them; keeps spouting nonsense like "you're a demon" or "let me out of the cage."

quest3_6-1:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>How very silly of them, don't you think?


quest3_7:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 12
    text: \n<ALICE>Oh, and something I noticed.\! Fiery creatures are \c[4]very susceptible to GLOW\c[0].
