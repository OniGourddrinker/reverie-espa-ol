# AILMENT INTROS - Appear in battle first inflicted on the party side. Global Troop
# ======== CHARM INTRO - This is added retroactively, can encounter in CH2 ========
# Also remember check SWH as CH4 she disappear for a moment, though it should never happen anyways
intro_charm_1:
    text: >
     \>SWEETHEART: \<\sinv[1]Ohoho!\sinv[0] These enemies seem rather CHARMing!

intro_charm_2:
    text: >
     \>SWEETHEART: \<When under the influence of their CHARM, you will find yourself doing their bidding!

intro_charm_3:
    text: >
     \>SPACEBOY: \<That is, allies will attack enemies and vice versa when under CHARM.

intro_charm_4:
    text: >
     \>SWEETHEART: \<You know that feeling all too well, don't you? Ohohohoho!

# ======== SICK INTRO ========
intro_sick_1:
    text: >
     \>DOUGHIE: \<Oho... someone is feeling rather SICK...

intro_sick_2:
    text: >
     \>DOUGHIE: \<When you're SICK, all of your stats are vastly decreased.

intro_sick_3:
    text: >
     \>DOUGHIE: \<It also causes both HEART and JUICE loss, even stronger than BURN or WEEP.

intro_sick_4:
    text: >
     \>DOUGHIE: \<It can happen at any time, too. Be careful what you eat... Oho..

# ======== FROZEN INTRO ========
intro_frozen_1:
    text: >
     \>SPACEBOY: \<Brrr... FROZEN... An ailment you can only get when NEUTRAL.

intro_frozen_2:
    text: >
     \>SPACEBOY: \<It causes the affected to be unable to move and cannot be buffed or healed.

intro_frozen_3:
    text: >
     \>SPACEBOY: \<This cold... it's a feeling that's familiar to me.
    
# ======== GLOW INTRO ========
intro_glow_1:
    text: >
     \>SPACEBOY: \<That's some bright GLOW there! It's an emotional ailment for HAPPY.

intro_glow_2:
    text: >
     \>SPACEBOY: \<The affected have their HIT RATE, EVASION and LUCK reduced heavily.

intro_glow_3:
    text: >
     \>SPACEBOY: \<In other words, they're almost guaranteed to be hit, a critical one at that.

intro_glow_4:
    text: >
     \>SPACEBOY: \<Low LUCK also means higher chance to be hit with other ailments, such as CHARM or SICK.

intro_glow_5:
    text: >
     \>SPACEBOY: \<It may not seem impressive at first, but it can snowball fast if you ignore it.

# ======== WEEP INTRO (Possible in CH4 with Alice) ========
intro_weep_1:
    text: >
     \>DOUGHIE: \<\sinv[1]Ohoooo...\sinv[0] WEEPING... The emotional ailment for SAD...

intro_weep_2:
    text: >
     \>DOUGHIE: \<WEEP causes the affected to lose JUICE over time, and make skills cost more JUICE.

intro_weep_3:
    text: >
     \>DOUGHIE: \<They also can't see well enough to use anything other than basic attacks.

intro_weep_4:
    text: >
     \>DOUGHIE: \<Their DEFENSE is reduced greatly as well, so they can't defend themselves either...

intro_weep_5:
    text: >
     \>DOUGHIE: \<It's a terrible time for everyone involved... especially the one WEEPing... oho...

# ======== SLEEP INTRO (Later than CH4) ========
intro_sleep_1:
    text: >
     \>SPACEBOY: \<Ah, someone's feeling SLEEPY.

intro_sleep_2:
    text: >
     \>SPACEBOY: \<SLEEPING battlers cannot act and always takes critical hit as well.

intro_sleep_3:
    text: >
     \>SPACEBOY: \<Though, a small upside from SLEEPING is the slight heal that comes from resting.

intro_sleep_4:
    text: >
     \>SPACEBOY: \<The SLEEP tends to last for a while, though they wake up when they take a hit.
     
intro_sleep_5:
    text: >
     \>SPACEBOY: \<Unlike FROZEN though, the battler can still have emotions while SLEEPING.
