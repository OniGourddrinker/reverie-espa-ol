# CHOICE: LISTEN MORE / NOT


# ================================ Self Part 2 ================================
# General idea: Constantly lamenting about the shunning, but no specific incident that can pin down the cause.
# Sometimes you might say change, but subconsciously sometimes people just resist change - it feels more natural to stay within safe space.
# Widow's the type to already put himself down, but sincerely believe others deserve better.
# Build parallel to SUNNY about anxiety of connecting people in general. This could also loosely comment on anxiety on reconnecting with people, building on top of the phone call night cutscene.

# ================================ AREA ================================
# The area he resides in is a Dreamworld version of the school corridor room of Blackspace 2, same as the Aubrey Fanmail event. 
# The PYREFLY forest above is also the same structure as LOOPING FOREST.
# The general idea is BS2 areas are the areas mid-process of corruption in original. 
# Blackspace spread stopped, the area was never corrupted like that, hence the Dreamworld look. 
# It is still a part of dreamworld, but a deeper and older kind, similar to how Lost Library is implied to persist in other iterations of dreamworld.
