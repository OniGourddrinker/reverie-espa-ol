#PX leaves. A black hole is revealed underneath where PX once stood. Time stops and the player is the only one able to move. Upon entering the hole, the player obtains their first piece of sheet music. Once the sheet music has been interacted with, the player returns to the party and the scene continues as normal.

Time stops may be jarring or a bit less serious considering it’s PX with the entire anime cliche style being the joke, considering other bosses in the future will also do something similar. The sheet could also be positioned in a previously inaccessible room that is just unlocked by the boss, rather than being directly dropped from.
