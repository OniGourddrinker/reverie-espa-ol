          \c[4]LUCK\c[0] affects both the odds
          of inflicting, and receiving 
          \c[4]CRITICAL\c[0] hits and \c[4]AILMENTS\c[0].

          In detail, The odds are based on 
          the difference between the user
          and target's luck.
          
          Each point of difference 
          increases the chance of inflicting
          and decreases the chance of 
          receiving \c[4]CRITICAL\c[0] hits
          or \c[4]AILMENTS\c[0] by \c[4]1%\c[0].
          
          The majority of skills, including basic 
          attacks, have a \c[4]base rate of 5%\c[0].

          The \c[4]EVASION\c[0] stat is a new stat that  
          reduces the odds of being hit by an 
          attack.
          
          Hit rate is now the difference
          between the attacker's \c[4]HIT RATE\c[0],
          and the defender's \c[4]EVASION\c[0].

          Both BUFFS and DEBUFFS are now on
          the same spectrum. Buffing will 
          reduce debuff tiers, and vice versa.
          
          Their effects also no longer 
          expire on their own.

          Both ATTACK and DEFENSE buffs are 
          now multiplicative on damage values, 
          rather than changing base ATTACK 
          or DEFENSE stats.

          Each tier of ATTACK BUFF increases 
          damage dealt by \c[4]x1.15\c[0]; 
          DEBUFF decreases by \c[4]x0.85\c[0].

          Each tier of DEFENSE BUFF reduces

          AILMENTS are negative status 
          effects, with some of them being 
          emotion-based.

          AILMENT rate operates similarly to
          CRITICAL rate, being based on the
          difference of the \c[4]LUCK\c[0] stat, with  
          each skill having specific base chance.
          
          Only one can be applied at a time, 
          with NON-EMOTIONAL AILMENTS having 
          a higher priority.

          \c[11]be seen when holding SHIFT or CTRL
          \c[11]keys while hovering over enemies.

          Emotional AILMENTS requires the 
          target to have a specific emotion
          before it can be applied.

          While being under its influence, it 
          \c[4]will lock the target into that emotion.\c[0]
          Its effects counters the emotion's 
          benefits and exacerbates its drawbacks.

          Emotional AILMENTS consist of 
          \c[4]BURN, GLOW, WEEP, and FROZEN.\c[0]
          They last for 2-3 turns.

          Non-emotional AILMENTS consist of 
          \c[4]SLEEP, CHARM, and SICK.\c[0]
          They last for 1-2 turns.

          Up to 6 skills can now be equipped 
          compared to original 4.

          SAD juice conversion is reduced:
          \c[4]SAD:\c[0] 30% => 20%
          \c[4]DEPRESSED:\c[0] 50% => 40%      
          \c[4]MISERABLE:\c[0] 100% => 60%

          Enemies now also use JUICE when
          using their skills, meaning they
          can run out of JUICE as well.

          TOASTED party members now gain
          half the experience rather than 
          nothing at all.

          This is closer to original game

          \c[4]EASY\c[0] further increase
          the benefits NORMAL mode provides.

          \c[4]HARD\c[0] gives some enemies unique skills,

          occasionally.

          This is the full experience as all
          enemy mechanics are shown.
