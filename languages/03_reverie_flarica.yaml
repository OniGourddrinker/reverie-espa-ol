# ================================================================
# FLARICA / UBER FIERY
#
# Flarica themself are not major presence, but will plan to appear here and there in extra area.
# They literally backseat you with game mechanic. Average SMT fan.
# ================================================================

# They speak in pseudo-Old English, but more of a pretend kind.\
# They're not that old. Don't overdo the ridiculousness of it though, it's just more for juxtaposition reasons.
# It's more the type of wanting to appear old more than a weird speaking quirk, 
# They can still occasionally break character just to be sassy.

    faceindex: 28
    text: \n<FLARICA>So like,\. you want to go in that mysterious dark corridor?\! I mean, some good stuff could be there, who knows. Can't blame ya.

adv_haltia_2:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 24
    text: \n<FLARICA>And the ghost is being annoying about it?\! They just seem to be worried about you, I wouldn't put much thought into it.

adv_haltia_3:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 24
    text: \n<FLARICA>Well, anyways.\. They probably already told you about their absorption gimmick, right?\! Well, here's another thing about them.

adv_haltia_4:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 29
    text: \n<FLARICA>Despite worrying for your safety,\. they lack the skill for self-care.\! In other words,\. \c[4]they don't clean debuffs\c[0].

adv_haltia_5:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 24
    text: \n<FLARICA>All ghosts seem to have high speed for some reason, so slowing them down might be a good idea.

adv_haltia_6:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 28
    text: \n<FLARICA>As for their big attack?\! Well, it's an offensive skill.\! Recall that \c[4]certain AILMENTS prevents using certain skills\c[0].\! Connect the dots yourself.

adv_haltia_7:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 25
    text: \n<FLARICA>I just gave you multiple options,\. now you go figure it out yourself.

    text: \n<FLARICA>Oh, did you get them?\! That was faster than I expected.

adv_haltia_a2:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 30
    text: \n<FLARICA>Hopefully you weren't just fighting them until their JUICE ran out...\. I mean, it \sinv[1]is\sinv[0] an option...\. It's just no fun.

    text: \n<FLARICA>Don't you just love bears?\! They're just like big cute dogs that eat berries and salmon.

adv_alice_2:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 29
    text: \n<FLARICA>An ANGRY one, though?\! Not as fun.\! Very icky,\. no good.\! So you gotta avoid that.

adv_alice_3:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 28
    text: \n<FLARICA>And that's where the girl comes in.\! She commands the bears...\. If she gets to make the bears ANGRY first, they'll go ham on you.

adv_alice_4:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 28
    text: \n<FLARICA>In other words,\. order matters.\! \c[4]Sometimes changing the speed of a single enemy may be preferable\c[0].\! EMOTIONS can also work,\. \c[4]recall that both SAD and HAPPY alters speed\c[0].

adv_alice_5:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 28
    text: \n<FLARICA>Additionally,\. that girl can instantly knock out any WEEPING member.\! And since it never directly does any damage...\. it counts as a non-offensive skill.\! Very funny, honestly.

adv_alice_6:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 28
    text: \n<FLARICA>Jokes aside,\. remember that \c[4]certain AILMENTS prevents using certain skills\c[0].\! She may be a bit resistant to one though,\. so you may need some LUCK.

adv_alice_a1:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW

adv_widow_5:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 28
    text: \n<FLARICA>But hey,\. that's also a good thing.\! A turn used up to call them in,\. that's pretty crucial.

adv_widow_6:
    faceset: SideCharacters_ReverieFW
    faceindex: 24
    text: \n<FLARICA>Additionally,\. \c[4]bugs and plants tend to BURN really easily.\c[0]\! My flamethrowers aren't for sale,\. so you'll have to make your own fire.
